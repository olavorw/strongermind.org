            <h1>Challenges</h1>

            <h2>Who are we?</h2>
            <p>We are a group of middle schoolers from Fremont, California, passionate about addressing mental health challenges in students. Despite our young age, we are driven by the desire to make a meaningful impact on the lives of our peers.</p>

            <h2>What's our goal?</h2>
            <p>Our goal is to create <strong>BunjAI</strong>, a personalized AI mental health chatbot that provides students with a supportive, non-judgmental platform where they can discuss their challenges and receive tailored guidance. By addressing issues like academic pressure, stress, and peer pressure, we hope to empower students to take charge of their mental well-being.</p>

            <h2>Why is this important?</h2>
            <p>In our city of Fremont, we see increasing mental health struggles among teenagers, especially those tied to academic competition. While our school offers some support through a Wellness Center, many students hesitate to seek help, fearing judgment or feeling disconnected from generic advice. We believe mental health support should be personal, relevant, and easy to access.</p>

            <h2>How are we tackling this?</h2>
            <p>Using our knowledge of STEM, we've developed <strong>strongermind.org</strong> and <strong>BunjAI</strong>. This AI chatbot is designed to provide students with a space where they can talk about their worries, get personalized advice, and track their well-being. We're using science, engineering, and technology to ensure the AI learns from interactions and offers better support over time.</p>

            <h2>Our future plans</h2>
            <p>We're not stopping with a chatbot. In the future, we plan to enhance <strong>BunjAI</strong> by incorporating features like daily habit tracking for sleep, food, exercise, and more. We also want to build a physical version of <strong>BunjAI</strong>-a mini, huggable robot made with RaspberryPi that can be a comforting, friendly companion for students struggling with mental health issues.</p>

            <h2>Why does this matter to us?</h2>
            <p>As students ourselves, we have faced the stress of balancing academics, fitting in, and trying to meet high expectations. We know how tough it can be, and we want to be part of the solution. By developing <strong>BunjAI</strong>, we aim to support our fellow students in Fremont and beyond, helping them navigate their mental health challenges without fear of judgment.</p>
