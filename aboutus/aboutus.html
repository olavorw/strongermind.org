            <h1>About Us</h1>

			<h2>Who are we?</h2>
			<p>We are a passionate team of middle school students from Fremont, California,  committed to supporting the mental wellbeing of students like us. Despite our young age, we are determined to make a meaningful impact in our community by creating tools that address the mental health challenges faced by students today.</p>

			<h2>What's our goal?</h2>
			<p>Our goal is to have a positive impact on our community and our peers through <strong>BunjAI</strong>, a personalized AI mental health chatbot made for students, that provides a supportive, non-judgmental platform where students can discuss their challenges and receive tailored guidance. By addressing issues like academic pressure, stress, and peer pressure, we hope to empower students to take charge of their mental well-being.</p>

			<h2>Why is this important?</h2>
			<p>In Fremont, weâ€™ve seen a growing number of teenagers struggling with their mental health, especially those with pressures to succeed and academic competition. While resources like our school's Wellness Center exist, many students are hesitant to reach out due to fears of judgment or feelings of disconnection from standard advice. We believe mental health support should be personal, relevant, and easily to accessible.</p>
			<h2>How are we tackling this?</h2>
			<p>Using our knowledge of STEM, we've developed <strong>strongermind.org</strong> and <strong>BunjAI</strong>. BunjAI is designed specifically for students and provides them with a space where they can talk about their worries, receive personalized advice, and track their well-being. We're using science, engineering, and technology to ensure the AI learns from interactions and offers better support the more it is used.</p>

			<h2>Our future plans</h2>
			<p>We're not stopping with a chatbot. In the future, we plan to enhance <strong>BunjAI</strong> by incorporating features such as daily habit tracking for sleep, nutrition, exercise, and other wellness factors. We envision building a physical version of <strong>BunjAI</strong>-a mini, huggable robot made with RaspberryPi technology that can be a comforting, friendly companion for students during a tough time.</p>

			<h2>Why does this matter to us?</h2>
			<p>As students, we have faced the stress of academics, fitting in, and high standards ourselves. We know how challenging it can be, and we want to be part of the solution. By developing <strong>BunjAI</strong>, we aim to support our fellow students in Fremont and beyond, helping them navigate their mental health challenges free from stigma or fear of judgement.</p>
